# Discord Facebook Marketplace Phone Monitor Bot

## Overview

This is a Discord webhook bot that monitors Facebook Marketplace UK for budget phone deals under £200. The bot searches for iPhone and Samsung phones, filters by price range, and sends real-time notifications to Discord channels via webhooks. The application is designed for deployment on Railway with automated monitoring intervals and UK-specific targeting across major cities like London, Birmingham, and Manchester.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modular, asynchronous architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Webhook Layer**: Discord webhook integration for notifications
- **Monitor Layer**: Core monitoring logic for Facebook Marketplace
- **Scraper Layer**: Web scraping and content extraction
- **Configuration Layer**: Environment-based configuration management
- **Utility Layer**: Helper functions for data processing and formatting

The system uses an event-driven architecture where the webhook bot orchestrates periodic monitoring tasks and sends notifications when new deals are found.

## Key Components

### 1. Discord Webhook Bot (`webhook_bot.py`)
- **Purpose**: Main webhook bot implementation for Discord notifications
- **Features**: Webhook message sending, monitoring coordination, and embed formatting
- **Architecture**: Asynchronous webhook client with aiohttp
- **Integration**: Coordinates with the marketplace monitor for automated checking

### 2. Marketplace Monitor (`monitor.py`)
- **Purpose**: Core monitoring logic for Facebook Marketplace listings
- **Features**: Listing detection, duplicate prevention using hash-based IDs, and data extraction
- **Architecture**: Asynchronous monitoring with configurable 30-second intervals
- **Data Storage**: In-memory tracking of seen listings to prevent duplicate notifications

### 3. Web Scraper (`web_scraper.py`)
- **Purpose**: Facebook Marketplace content extraction using trafilatura
- **Features**: HTML parsing, content extraction, and listing data structuring
- **Architecture**: Session-based HTTP client with proper headers and error handling
- **Technology**: Uses trafilatura library for robust content extraction

### 4. Facebook Connector (`facebook_connector.py`)
- **Purpose**: Enhanced connector with multiple scraping strategies
- **Features**: User-agent rotation, session management, and fallback mechanisms
- **Architecture**: Async HTTP client with TCP connector and timeout handling
- **Resilience**: Multiple approaches for handling Facebook's anti-scraping measures

### 5. Configuration Management (`config.py`)
- **Purpose**: Environment-based configuration with validation
- **Features**: Price filters (£0-£200), brand selection, and search keyword generation
- **Architecture**: Class-based configuration with validation methods
- **Environment Variables**: Supports Discord webhook URL, intervals, and location filters

### 6. Utility Functions (`utils.py`)
- **Purpose**: Data processing and Discord embed creation
- **Features**: Phone information extraction, brand detection, and embed formatting
- **Architecture**: Pure functions for text processing and Discord message formatting

## Data Flow

1. **Initialization**: Bot validates configuration and starts monitoring task
2. **Monitoring Loop**: Periodic checks (every 30 seconds) for new marketplace listings
3. **Data Extraction**: Web scraper fetches and parses Facebook Marketplace content
4. **Filtering**: Listings filtered by brand (iPhone/Samsung), price (under £200), and location (UK)
5. **Deduplication**: Hash-based ID system prevents duplicate notifications
6. **Notification**: New listings formatted as Discord embeds and sent via webhook
7. **Persistence**: Seen listings tracked in memory for session duration

## External Dependencies

### Core Libraries
- **aiohttp**: Asynchronous HTTP client for web requests and webhook delivery
- **trafilatura**: Content extraction from web pages with robust HTML parsing
- **beautifulsoup4**: HTML parsing support for trafilatura
- **brotli**: Compression support for HTTP requests

### Discord Integration
- **Webhook-based**: Uses Discord webhooks instead of bot tokens for simpler deployment
- **Rich Embeds**: Formatted notifications with phone details, prices, and locations
- **Custom Branding**: Bot avatar and username for marketplace notifications

### Facebook Marketplace
- **UK-specific URLs**: Targets London marketplace with UK location filters
- **Category Filtering**: Focuses on cell-phones-smart-watches category
- **Search Terms**: Dynamic keyword generation for iPhone and Samsung models

## Deployment Strategy

### Railway Platform
- **Builder**: Nixpacks for automatic dependency detection
- **Runtime**: Python 3.11 specified in runtime.txt
- **Restart Policy**: Automatic restart on failure with 10 retry limit
- **Environment Variables**: Discord webhook URL and monitoring configuration

### Configuration Requirements
- `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`: Required Discord webhook URL for notifications
- `MONITOR_INTERVAL`: Check frequency in seconds (default: 30)
- `MIN_PRICE`: Minimum price filter in GBP (default: 0)
- `MAX_PRICE`: Maximum price filter in GBP (default: 200)
- `LOCATION_FILTER`: Geographic targeting (default: UK)

### Monitoring Features
- **Real-time Alerts**: 30-second monitoring intervals for quick deal detection
- **Price Targeting**: Focus on budget phones under £200
- **Brand Filtering**: iPhone and Samsung model detection
- **Location Specific**: UK cities including London, Birmingham, Manchester
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Hash-based tracking of seen listings
